# Hi, I'm Ishaan

I'm a second-year computer science and math student at the University of Toronto. Most of my projects are inspired by algorithms or simulations I find interesting, as well as software I wish existed.

I'm currently trying to learn FFT, and how to make my own guitar tuner TUI.

The languages I mainly use are Python and C/C++, and I'm trying to learn Rust.

Contributions and feedback are always welcome, especially on my C++ projects.

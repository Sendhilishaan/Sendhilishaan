# Hi, I'm Ishaan

I'm a second-year computer science and math student at the University of Toronto. Most of my projects are inspired by software I wish existed or tools I personally want to use. I've recently gotten interested in machine learning, and am self learning through building projects and reading books.

I'm currently trying to learn how to make my own guitar tuner TUI.

The languages I mainly use are Python and JavaScript, and I'm trying to learn Lua and Rust.

Feel free to open issues, stage commits, or branch any of the files. Contributions and feedback are always welcome!

## Hi, I'm Ishaan

I'm a second-year Computer Science and Statistics student at the University of Toronto who loves building things. Most of my projects are inspired by software I wish existed or tools I personally want to use. I've recently gotten interested in machine learning, and am self learning through building projects and reading books.

I'm currently learning ML and starting a regression visualiser in Python using only NumPy and MatPLotLib

The languages I mainly use are Python and JavaScript, and I'm trying to learn C++ and Lua.

Feel free to open issues, stage commits, or branch any of the files. Contributions and feedback are always welcome!

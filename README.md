## Hi, I'm Ishaan

I'm a second-year Computer Science and Statistics student at the University of Toronto who loves building things. Most of my projects are inspired by software I wish existed or tools I personally want to use.

I'm currently working on lofi-terminal â€” a terminal-based app that lets you add, manage, and stream YouTube audio directly from your terminal with a built-in CLI interface.

The languages I mainly use are Python and JavaScript, and I'm trying to learn C++. 

Feel free to open issues, stage commits, or branch any of the files. Contributions and feedback are always welcome!
